In `chrome-extension/popup.js`, line 9, change:
```javascript
const DOC_CREATOR_URL = 'https://your-domain.com/doc-creator'; // Replace with your actual URL
```

**Where is your Doc Creator tool hosted?** 
- Local file? (`file:///path/to/file.html`)
- Web server? (`https://your-domain.com/tool`)
- Still localhost? (keep as is for now)

- Open `chrome-extension/store-assets-generator.html` in your browser
- Click all the download links to save the images
- You'll get: icon128.png, promo-small-440x280.png, screenshot-1280x800.png, etc.

1. Go to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole/
