## Learning Modules

**A:** Each module is 20-40 minutes total, but they're broken into 5-10 minute lessons. Complete at your own pace!

### Q: Can I retake quizzes?
**A:** Absolutely! Retake as many times as you need. The goal is learning, not testing.

**A:** We recommend starting with Module 1 (Levels of Care) as it's foundational, but you can access any module anytime.

## Technical Questions

### Q: Which browsers work?
**A:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari - all modern browsers work great. We recommend Chrome for the best extension experience.

### Q: Will this work on a tablet or phone?
**A:** The interface is responsive and works on tablets. Phones work but are cramped - we recommend desktop/laptop for best experience.

### Q: Is my data secure?
**A:** Yes! All data is stored locally on your device. Nothing goes to external servers. Client profiles don't even save to disk (HIPAA compliant).

### Q: Can I use this at home?
**A:** If your organization allows it, yes! Just copy the HTML file to your personal computer.

### Q: What if my browser crashes?
**A:** Your learning progress and program library are saved. Active work autosaves every 30 seconds, so you'll lose at most 30 seconds of work.

## Chrome Extension

### Q: Is the extension required?
**A:** No, but it makes building your program library 10x faster. Highly recommended!

### Q: Is it safe?
**A:** Yes! The extension only reads public webpage data. It doesn't access your personal information or browsing history.

### Q: Which websites does it work on?
**A:** Any treatment center website. The more standard the website structure, the better the extraction.

### Q: What if extraction fails?
**A:** You can still manually enter program data, or try refreshing the page and extracting again.

### Q: Can I edit extracted data?
**A:** Yes! After extraction, review and edit any fields before saving.

## HIPAA & Compliance

**A:** Yes! The system is designed with HIPAA in mind:
- No PHI stored permanently
- Session-only client data
- Auto-clear on browser close
- Local storage only (no cloud)

### Q: Can I include patient names in documents?
**A:** You CAN, but we don't recommend it. Use initials or "the client" instead.

### Q: What about exported documents?
**A:** Once exported, YOU are responsible for handling them per HIPAA guidelines (secure email, encrypted storage, etc.)

### Q: Should I use this on a shared computer?
**A:** Only if you log out completely after each session. Better to use on your personal work computer.
