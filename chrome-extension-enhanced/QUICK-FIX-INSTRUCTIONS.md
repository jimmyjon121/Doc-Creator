# QUICK FIX - Immediate Solution

## The Problem
The enhanced files have a loading conflict. Here's the immediate fix:

## Step 1: Manual Fix (Do This Now)

### Option A: Use the Original Working Version
1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\JimBe\CursorDocCreationRepo\Doc-Creator-1\`
3. Use the `chrome-extension-v3` folder instead (the original working version)
4. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/`
5. Remove the current extension
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-extension-v3` folder
7. This will give you the working version immediately

### Option B: Quick Fix Current Version
1. Navigate to: `C:\Users\JimBe\CursorDocCreationRepo\Doc-Creator-1\chrome-extension-enhanced\`
2. Open `manifest.json` in Notepad
3. Find this line: `"service_worker": "background-enhanced.js"`
4. Change it to: `"service_worker": "background.js"`
5. Save the file
6. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
7. Click the refresh button on the extension
8. Try again on a fresh tab

## Step 2: Test It Works
1. Open a new tab
2. Go to: https://www.paradigmtreatment.com/
3. Wait for page to load completely
4. Click extension icon
5. Click "Extract Program Info"

## Why This Happened
The new enhanced files need to be loaded differently than regular content scripts. The advanced-extractor.js and clinical-formatter-v2.js are class-based modules that can't be injected directly as content scripts.

## Permanent Solution Coming
I'll create a properly integrated version that loads these modules correctly. For now, use either:
- The original `chrome-extension-v3` folder (guaranteed to work)
- The quick-fixed `chrome-extension-enhanced` folder (after changing manifest.json)

Both will extract program information successfully!
