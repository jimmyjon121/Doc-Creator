## Why AI Extraction is Better

### Traditional Extraction:
- ‚ùå Misses context and nuance
- ‚ùå Gets confused by website layouts
- ‚ùå Extracts irrelevant content
- ‚ùå Limited to simple pattern matching

### AI-Powered Extraction:
- ‚úÖ **Understands context** - Knows "DBT" means Dialectical Behavior Therapy
- ‚úÖ **Filters intelligently** - Ignores ads, cookies, and irrelevant content
- ‚úÖ **Extracts comprehensively** - Finds information even in complex layouts
- ‚úÖ **Structures perfectly** - Organizes data exactly as needed for clinical docs

## Features

### üéØ What Gets Extracted:
- Program name and location
- All levels of care (Residential, PHP, IOP, etc.)
- Age ranges and populations served
- 40+ therapy modalities (categorized as evidence-based vs experiential)
- Clinical specializations (Trauma, Anxiety, Depression, etc.)
- Program structure (length of stay, phases, ratios)
- Family involvement details
- Staff credentials
- Facilities and amenities
- Insurance accepted
- Accreditations
- Contact information

### üí° Smart Features:
- **Automatic categorization** - AI knows CBT is evidence-based, Art Therapy is experiential
- **Context understanding** - Extracts "30-90 days" as length of stay, not random numbers
- **Relationship detection** - Links staff credentials to clinical quality
- **Confidence scoring** - Shows how complete the extraction is

## Cost

### Google Gemini (Recommended):
- **FREE** - 60 requests per minute
- **No credit card required**
- **Perfect for this use case**

### OpenAI GPT-3.5 (Alternative):
- ~$0.002 per extraction
- More powerful but requires payment
- Optional backup if Gemini isn't sufficient

### Chrome Built-in AI (Future):
- Coming soon to Chrome
- Will work without any API key
- Extension will auto-detect and use when available

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key"
- Make sure you copied the entire key
- Check that you're using the Gemini API key, not something else
- Try generating a new key

### "No data extracted"
- Make sure you've saved your API key in settings
- Check that you're on a treatment center website
- Try refreshing the page and extracting again

### "Extraction seems incomplete"
- Some sites may require navigating to specific pages (About, Programs, etc.)
- The AI works best with comprehensive program pages
- Try the program's main "About" or "Treatment" page

## Privacy & Security

- **Your API key is stored locally** in your browser only
- **No data is sent to our servers** - everything happens between your browser and Google/OpenAI
- **HIPAA-safe output** - No patient information is ever extracted
- **Clinical-grade formatting** - Ready for professional documentation

## Support

Need help? The extension will automatically fall back to rule-based extraction if AI isn't available, so you're never stuck!
