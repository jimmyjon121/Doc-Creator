## What This Fix Does

This is a complete rewrite using Gemini's simpler, more reliable approach. It strips away all the complexity that was causing issues and focuses on actually extracting data that works.

## Key Changes

2. **Clean popup interface** - Shows real-time stats and extracted data
3. **Reliable content script** - Direct extraction without complex class structures
4. **No more 0 data points** - Actually counts and displays extracted information

## How to Install

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Remove** any existing version of the extension
3. Click **"Load unpacked"**
4. Select the `chrome-extension-enhanced` folder
