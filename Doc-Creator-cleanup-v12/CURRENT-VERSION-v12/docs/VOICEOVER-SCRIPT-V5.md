- **Scene 2:** Explanatory but not rushed. Natural pauses between widgets.
- **Scene 3:** Enthusiastic about capabilities. Speed up slightly during filter description.
- **Scene 4:** Sense of wonder at geographic scope. Slow down on "five hundred twenty-nine."
- **Scene 5:** Efficient, satisfying. Quick pace as features demonstrate themselves.
- **Scene 6:** Start anxious, transition to calm. "Sleep well tonight" is warm and reassuring.
- **Scene 7:** Inspirational, triumphant. Each value word gets emphasis.

### Pronunciation
