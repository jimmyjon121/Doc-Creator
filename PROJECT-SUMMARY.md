## Chrome Extension (v1.6.2)

### Purpose
Extract program information from treatment center websites and send it directly to the Doc Creator.

### Key Features
- **Multi-page Extraction**: Analyzes up to 30 pages per site
- **Clinical-grade Writeups**: Professional formatting
- **Site-specific Extractors**: Custom logic for problematic sites
- **Direct Integration**: "Copy to Tool" sends data to Doc Creator

### Technical Details
- **Manifest V3**: Modern Chrome extension architecture
- **Content Scripts**: 
  - `content.js`: Main extraction logic
  - `clinical-extractor.js`: Clinical writeup generation
  - `improved-extractor.js`: Enhanced data extraction
- **Background Worker**: Handles multi-page fetching
- **Popup Interface**: Shows extraction progress and stats

### Current Issues (as of end of conversation)
- "Could not establish connection" error on some sites
- Requires page refresh after extension update
- Some sites may block content script injection

## Technical Architecture

### Data Storage
- **localStorage**: Encrypted client-side storage
- **sessionStorage**: Temporary session data
- **No Backend**: Completely client-side application

### Libraries Used (embedded)
- **pdf-lib**: PDF generation
- **html2canvas**: HTML to image conversion
- **Web Crypto API**: Encryption and hashing

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge (primary)
- Firefox (supported)
- Safari (limited testing)

## Development Environment
- **Local Server**: `python -m http.server 8000`
- **URL**: http://localhost:8000/AppsCode-DeluxeCMS.html
- **File Location**: `C:\Users\JimBe\CursorDocCreationRepo\Doc-Creator-1`

## Recent Major Updates

### Security Overhaul
- Replaced base64 encoding with SHA-256 hashing
- Implemented AES-256-GCM encryption for all stored data
- Added automatic migration for existing unencrypted data

### UI/UX Improvements
- Added user profile system with logout
- Enhanced welcome animation
- Fixed Case Manager button layouts
- Improved program selection interface

### Chrome Extension Enhancement
- Version progression: 1.0.0 â†’ 1.6.2
- Added multi-page extraction
- Implemented clinical-grade formatting
- Fixed integration issues

## Known Limitations
1. **Single File Size**: 12,644 lines can be challenging to maintain
2. **No Real Backend**: All processing is client-side
3. **Browser Storage Limits**: ~10MB for localStorage
4. **Chrome Extension**: Some sites block content scripts

## Next Steps / Recommendations
1. Consider splitting into multiple files for maintainability
2. Add real backend for better security and scalability
3. Implement proper user management system
4. Add automated testing
5. Create documentation for clinical staff

## Quick Start for New Developer
1. Clone/download `AppsCode-DeluxeCMS.html`
2. Run `python -m http.server 8000` in the directory
3. Open http://localhost:8000/AppsCode-DeluxeCMS.html
4. Login with `MasterAdmin` / `S3cur3P@ssw0rd!`
5. For Chrome extension: Load `chrome-extension-enhanced` folder as unpacked extension

## Important Notes
- **HIPAA Compliance**: No medical records are permanently stored
- **Encryption Key**: Derived from user password - if forgotten, data is unrecoverable
- **Chrome Extension**: Must be reloaded after updates
- **Development**: Always use HTTPS in production for security
